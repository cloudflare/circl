**CIRCL** (Cloudflare Interoperable, Reusable Cryptographic Library) is a collection
of cryptographic primitives written in Go. The goal of this library is to be used as a tool for
experimental deployment of cryptographic algorithms targeting Post-Quantum (PQ) and Elliptic
Curve Cryptography (ECC).

## Security Disclaimer

ðŸš¨ This library is offered as-is, and without a guarantee. Therefore, it is expected that changes in the code, repository, and API occur in the future. We recommend to take caution before using this library in a production application since part of its content is experimental. All security issues must be reported, please notify us immediately following the instructions given in our [Security Policy](https://github.com/cloudflare/circl/security/policy).

## Installation

You can get CIRCL by fetching:

```sh
go get -u github.com/cloudflare/circl
```

## Testing and Benchmarking

Library comes with number of make targets which can be used for testing and
benchmarking:

- ``test`` performs testing of the binary.
- ``bench`` runs benchmarks.
- ``cover`` produces coverage.
- ``lint`` runs set of linters on the code base.
